# angularities
Experiments with angular, and bootstrap as well

Start an http-server (get it from npm) and load the pages in the directives dir, for example:
- http://localhost:8080/directives/directives.html
- http://localhost:8080/directives/navigation2.html
- http://localhost:8080/directives/navigation-with-flex.html
- http://localhost:8080/directives/bk_rules_lab.html (WIP)
- http://localhost:8080/angello/angello.html (just following a Manning book)
- http://localhost:8080/jenkov/watch-digest-apply.html (Jakob Jenkov rulez)

Subdir panel contains reasonably completed files from a real webapp.
